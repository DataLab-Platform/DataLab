msgid "2D Peak Detection"
msgstr ""

msgid "DataLab provides a \"2D Peak Detection\" feature which is based on a minimum-maximum filter algorithm."
msgstr ""

msgid "2D peak detection parameters."
msgstr ""

msgid "How to use the feature:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Create or open an image in DataLab workspace"
msgstr ""

msgid "Select \"2d peak detection\" in \"Analysis\" menu"
msgstr ""

msgid "Enter parameters \"Neighborhoods size\" and \"Relative threhold\""
msgstr ""

msgid "Check \"Create regions of interest\" if you want a ROI defined for each detected peak (this may become useful when using another computation afterwards on each area around peaks, e.g. contour detection)"
msgstr ""

msgid "2d peak detection results (see test \"peak2d_app.py\")"
msgstr ""

msgid "Results are shown in a table:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Each row is associated to a detected peak"
msgstr ""

msgid "First column shows the ROI index (0 if no ROI is defined on input image)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Second and third columns show peak coordinates"
msgstr ""

msgid "Example of 2D peak detection."
msgstr ""

msgid "The 2d peak detection algorithm works in the following way:"
msgstr ""

msgid "First, the minimum and maximum filtered images are computed using a sliding window algorithm with a user-defined size (implementation based on `scipy.ndimage.minimum_filter <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.minimum_filter.html>`_ and `scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter.html>`_)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Then, the difference between the maximum and minimum filtered images is clipped at a user-defined threshold"
msgstr ""

msgid "Resulting image features are labeled using `scipy.ndimage.label <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.label.html>`_"
msgstr ""

msgid "Peak coordinates are then obtained from labels center"
msgstr ""

msgid "Duplicates are eventually removed"
msgstr ""

msgid "The 2d peak detection parameters are the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "\"Neighborhoods size\": size of the sliding window (see above)"
msgstr ""

msgid "\"Relative threshold\": detection threshold"
msgstr ""

msgid "Feature is based on ``get_2d_peaks_coords`` function from ``sigima.algorithms`` module:"
