msgid "Technical Validation"
msgstr ""

msgid "DataLab technical validation is based on two key concepts: **ground-truth data** and **analytical validation**."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ground-truth data"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ground-truth data is data that is known to be correct. It is used to validate the results of computational analysis."
msgstr ""

msgid "In DataLab, ground-truth data may be obtained from a variety of sources, including:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Experimental data"
msgstr ""

msgid "Simulated data"
msgstr ""

msgid "Synthetic data"
msgstr ""

msgid "Data from a trusted source"
msgstr ""

msgid "Analytical validation"
msgstr ""

msgid "Analytical validation is the process of comparing the results of computational analysis to ground-truth data. This is done to ensure that the results are accurate and reliable."
msgstr ""

msgid "In DataLab, analytical validation is implemented using a variety of techniques, including:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Cross-validation with an analytical model (from a trusted source, e.g. `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_ or `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Statistical analysis"
msgstr ""

msgid "Visual inspection"
msgstr ""

msgid "Expert review"
msgstr ""

msgid "Scope"
msgstr ""

msgid "The scope of technical validation in DataLab includes all compute functions that operate on DataLab's signal and image objects (i.e. :class:`sigima.obj.SignalObj` and :class:`sigima.obj.ImageObj`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "This includes functions for (all functions are named ``compute_<function_name>``):"
msgstr ""

msgid "Signal processing (:mod:`sigima.computation.signal`)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Image processing (:mod:`sigima.computation.image`)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Implementation"
msgstr ""

msgid "The tests are implemented using the `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ framework."
msgstr ""

msgid "When writing a new technical validation test, the following rules should be followed regarding the test function:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The test function should be named:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``test_signal_<function_name>`` for signal compute functions"
msgstr ""

msgid "``test_image_<function_name>`` for image compute functions"
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``signal`` or ``image`` prefix is used to indicate the type of object that the function operates on. It may be omitted if the function operates exclusively on one type of object (e.g. ``test_adjust_gamma`` is the test function for the ``compute_adjust_gamma`` function, which operates on images)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The test function should be marked with the ``@pytest.mark.validation`` decorator."
msgstr ""

msgid "Following those rules ensures that:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The tests are easily identified as technical validation tests."
msgstr ""

msgid "The tests can be executed separately using the command line interface (see :ref:`run_scientific_validation_tests`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The tests are automatically discovered for synthetizing the validation status of the compute functions (see :ref:`validation_status`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Executing tests"
msgstr ""

msgid "In DataLab, technical validation tests are disseminated in the test suite of the project, but they can also be executed separately using the command line interface."
msgstr ""

msgid "See paragraph :ref:`run_scientific_validation_tests` for more information on how to run technical validation tests."
