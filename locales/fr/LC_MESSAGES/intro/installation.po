msgstr ""

msgid "Package manager ``pip``"
msgstr ""

msgid "DataLab's package ``datalab`` is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) on the following URL: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/datalab."
msgstr ""

msgid "Installing DataLab from PyPI with Qt is as simple as running this command (you may need to use ``pip3`` instead of ``pip`` on some systems):"
msgstr ""

msgid "Or, if you prefer, you can install DataLab without the Qt library (not recommended):"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you already have a previous version of DataLab installed, you can upgrade it by running the same command with the ``--upgrade`` option:"

msgid "All-in-one installer"
msgstr ""

msgid ":octicon:`info;1em;sd-text-info` :bdg-info-line:`Windows`"
msgstr ""

msgid "DataLab is available as a stand-alone application for Windows, which does not require any Python distribution to be installed. Just run the installer and you're good to go!"

msgid "DataLab all-in-one installer for Windows"

msgstr ""

msgid "DataLab Windows installer is available for Windows 7 SP1, 8, 10 and 11."
msgstr ""

msgid ":octicon:`alert;1em;sd-text-warning` On Windows 7 SP1, before running DataLab (or any other Python 3 application), you must install Microsoft Update `KB2533623` (`Windows6.1-KB2533623-x64.msu`) and also may need to install `Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistribuable package <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Python distribution"
msgstr ""

msgid "DataLab is also available within a ready-to-use Python distribution, based on `WinPython <https://winpython.github.io/>`_. This distribution is called `DataLab-WinPython <https://github.com/DataLab-Platform/DataLab-WinPython?tab=readme-ov-file#datalab-winpython>`_ and is available in the `DataLab-WinPython Releases <https://github.com/DataLab-Platform/DataLab-WinPython/releases>`_ section."
msgstr ""

msgid "DataLab-WinPython is a ready-to-use Python distribution including the DataLab platform."
msgstr ""

msgid "The main difference with the all-in-one installer is that you can use the Python distribution for other purposes than running DataLab, and you may also extend it with additional packages. On the downside, it is also *much bigger* than the all-in-one installer because it includes a full Python distribution."
msgstr ""

msgid "DataLab-WinPython Control Panel"
msgstr ""

msgid "Whereas the all-in-one installer provides a monolithic package that guarantees the compatibility of all its components because it cannot be modified by the user, the WinPython distribution is more flexible and thus can be broken by a bad manipulation of the Python distribution by the user. This should be taken into account when choosing the installation method."

msgstr ""

msgid "Or, if you prefer, you can install it manually by running the following command from the root directory of the source package:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Finally, you can also build your own Wheel package and install it using ``pip``, by running the following command from the root directory of the source package (this requires the ``build`` and ``wheel`` packages to be installed):"
msgstr ""

msgid "Development version"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you want to try the latest development version of DataLab, you can install it directly from the master branch of the Git repository."
msgstr ""

msgid "The first time you install DataLab from the Git repository, enter the following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Then, if at some point you want to upgrade to the latest version of DataLab, just run the same command with options to force the reinstall of the package without handling dependencies (because it would reinstall all dependencies):"
msgstr ""

msgid "If dependencies have changed, you may need to execute the same command as above, but without the ``--no-deps`` option."
