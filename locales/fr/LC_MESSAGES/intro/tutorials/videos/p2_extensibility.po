msgid "The first common point between these three approaches is that they all rely on DataLab's high-level API, which allow to interact with almost every aspect of the software. This API is here accessed using Python scripts, but it may also be accessed using any other language when using the remote control approach (because it relies on a standard communication protocol, XML-RPC)."

msgid "The second common point is that they all use Python code, and compatible proxy objects, so that the same code can be at least partially reused in the three approaches."
