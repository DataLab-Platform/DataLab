msgstr ""

msgid "üß± Other Tasks"
msgstr ""

msgid "‚Ä¢ Create a DataLab plugin template"
msgstr ""

msgid "üîÑ Support for Data Acquisition"
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding support for data acquisition would be a major step forward in making DataLab not only a platform for signal and image processing, but also a **versatile tool for real-time experimental workflows**. The idea would be to allow users to acquire data directly from various hardware devices (e.g., cameras, digitizers, spectrometers, etc.) **within DataLab itself**."
msgstr ""

msgid "Such a feature would enable **seamless integration between acquisition and analysis**, allowing users to process and visualize data immediately after it is captured, without needing to switch tools or export/import files."
msgstr ""

msgid "While no formal design has been established yet, a viable approach could be to:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Introduce a **new plugin family dedicated to data acquisition**, following the modular architecture of DataLab;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Define a **generic API for acquisition plugins**, ensuring flexibility and compatibility across device types;"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Leverage existing solutions** such as [PyMoDAQ](https://pymodaq.cnrs.fr/), a Python-based data acquisition framework already compatible with a wide range of laboratory instruments."
msgstr ""

msgid "A potential **collaboration with the PyMoDAQ development team** could be explored, to benefit from their ecosystem and avoid duplicating efforts. This would also help foster interoperability and promote open standards in the Python scientific instrumentation community."

msgid "üåê Web Frontend"
msgstr ""

msgid "As DataLab's modular architecture evolves, a natural next step is to provide a **web-based frontend** to complement the existing desktop application."
msgstr ""

msgid "A web frontend would allow users to:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Run DataLab remotely** (e.g. from a server or cloud platform) and access it via a browser;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Perform processing and visualization tasks without needing a local Python environment;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Facilitate **collaborative data analysis**, sharing sessions or results with colleagues;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Integrate with JupyterHub, dashboards, or lab management tools for centralized usage."
msgstr ""

msgid "This frontend could be built on top of the upcoming `DataLab-core` library, exposing its features through a web interface ‚Äî possibly leveraging tools like **JupyterLab extensions**, **Panel**, or **Dash**, depending on the chosen stack."
msgstr ""

msgid "While still exploratory, this direction would increase **accessibility, portability, and scalability** of DataLab, especially in academic, industrial, and cloud-based environments."
msgstr ""

msgid "‚è±Ô∏è Support for Time Series"
msgstr ""

msgid "DataLab currently focuses on generic signal and image processing, but many use cases ‚Äî especially in scientific instrumentation and experimental physics ‚Äî involve **time series data**."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding dedicated support for time series would make it easier to:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Handle signals with associated timestamps or non-uniform sampling;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Perform time-aware processing and visualization (e.g., event alignment, time-based filtering, resampling);"
msgstr ""

msgid "Integrate with external systems generating time-indexed data."
msgstr ""

msgid "This feature is tracked in [Issue #27](https://github.com/DataLab-Platform/DataLab/issues/27), where potential use cases and design considerations are discussed."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "üóÉÔ∏è Database Connectors"
msgstr ""

msgid "Currently, DataLab operates primarily on files and in-memory data structures. Adding **connectors to databases** would significantly extend its capabilities, especially for users dealing with large, structured, or historical datasets."
msgstr ""

msgid "This feature would allow DataLab to:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Query and load data** from SQL or NoSQL databases (e.g. PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.);"
msgstr ""

msgid "Support metadata-driven workflows, where experiments or datasets are referenced from a database;"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Store analysis results** or annotations back into a database for traceability and reproducibility;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Facilitate integration into lab information management systems (LIMS) or enterprise data infrastructures."
msgstr ""

msgid "The design could include:"
msgstr ""

msgid "A **plugin-based system** for supporting various database backends;"
msgstr ""

msgid "A simple configuration interface for connection settings and query management;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Integration with pandas or SQLAlchemy for flexible data exchange."
msgstr ""

msgid "This evolution would help bridge the gap between **data acquisition, analysis, and long-term storage**, enabling more robust scientific data workflows."
msgstr ""

msgid "üìì Jupyter Plugin for Interactive Data Analysis"
msgstr ""

#, python-brace-format
msgid "Although DataLab can already be remotely controlled from a Jupyter notebook ‚Äî thanks to its existing remote control capabilities (see {ref}`ref-to-remote-control`) ‚Äî the user experience could be greatly enhanced by developing a **dedicated Jupyter plugin**."
msgstr ""

msgid "This plugin would provide a **tighter integration** between Jupyter and DataLab, offering the following features:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Use DataLab as a **Jupyter kernel**, enabling direct access to its processing capabilities from within a notebook;"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Display numerical results from DataLab in Jupyter**, and vice versa ‚Äî for example, importing results computed in a Jupyter notebook into the DataLab interface;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Allow **interactive data manipulation**: use DataLab for efficient signal and image operations, and Jupyter for custom or home-made data analysis routines;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Bridge scripting and GUI workflows, making DataLab more attractive for scientific users familiar with Jupyter environments."
msgstr ""

msgid "Technically, this plugin could rely on the **Jupyter kernel interface** to expose DataLab's capabilities in an interactive programming context."
msgstr ""

msgid "Such integration would reinforce DataLab‚Äôs role in the scientific Python ecosystem and facilitate reproducible, notebook-driven analysis workflows."
msgstr ""

msgid "üß© Spyder Plugin for Interactive Data Analysis"
msgstr ""

msgid "A plugin for the [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) would address the **same use cases as the Jupyter plugin**, providing seamless integration between DataLab and Spyder‚Äôs interactive environment."
msgstr ""

msgid "This plugin would allow users to:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Interact with DataLab directly from Spyder;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Visualize or send data between the DataLab GUI and the Spyder console;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Use DataLab‚Äôs processing capabilities in real time while scripting custom analysis workflows in Spyder."
msgstr ""

#, python-brace-format
msgid "As with the Jupyter integration, this plugin could be implemented by leveraging the **Jupyter kernel interface** (see {ref}`ref-to-remote-control`), which Spyder already supports internally."
msgstr ""

msgid "Such a plugin would enhance DataLab's usability for scientists and engineers who prefer Spyder‚Äôs integrated development environment for exploratory analysis."
msgstr ""

msgid "üß† Jupyter Kernel Interface for DataLab"
msgstr ""

msgid "Implementing a native **Jupyter kernel interface** for DataLab would provide a more integrated way to use it from other environments such as **Jupyter notebooks, Spyder, or Visual Studio Code**."
msgstr ""

msgid "This interface would allow:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Direct control of DataLab from third-party tools that support Jupyter kernels;"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Two-way data exchange**: e.g., displaying DataLab results inside a notebook, or visualizing Jupyter-generated data inside the DataLab GUI;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tighter integration into scripting workflows and IDEs beyond simple remote control."
msgstr ""

#, python-brace-format
msgid "However, based on initial exploration, implementing a full Jupyter kernel may be **non-trivial and potentially time-consuming**. Given that remote control already enables communication between DataLab and Jupyter (see {ref}`ref-to-remote-control`), the added value of a full kernel integration should be carefully evaluated against its complexity and maintenance cost."
msgstr ""

msgid "This option remains open for discussion depending on user demand and development resources."
msgstr ""

msgid "üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance Plan"
msgstr ""

msgid "üîÑ 2026: Transition to gRPC for Remote Control"
msgstr ""
