msgid "Git Workflow"
msgstr ""

msgid "This document describes the Git workflow used in the DataLab project, based on a ``main`` branch, a ``develop`` branch, and feature-specific branches. It also defines how bug fixes are managed."
msgstr ""

msgid "This workflow is a simplified version of the `Gitflow Workflow <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow>`_. It has been adapted to suit the needs of the DataLab project at the current stage of development. In the near future, we may consider adopting a more complex workflow, e.g. by adding release branches."

msgid "Branching Model"
msgstr ""

msgid "Main Branches"
msgstr ""

msgid "``main``: Represents the stable, production-ready version of the project."
msgstr ""

msgid "``develop``: Used for ongoing development and integration of new features."
msgstr ""

msgid "Feature Branches"
msgstr ""

msgid "``develop/feature_name``: Used for the development of new features."
msgstr ""

msgid "Created from ``develop``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Merged back into ``develop`` once completed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Deleted after merging."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bug Fix Branches"
msgstr ""

msgid "``fix/xxx``: Used for general bug fixes that are not urgent."
msgstr ""

msgid "``hotfix/xxx``: Used for urgent production-critical fixes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Created from ``main``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Merged back into ``main``."
msgstr ""

msgid "The fix is then cherry-picked into ``develop``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hotfixes (high-priority fixes) will be integrated in the next maintenance release (X.Y.Z -> Z+1), while fixes (low-priority fixes) will be integrated in the next feature release (X.Y -> Y+1)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Workflow for New Features"
msgstr ""

msgid "Create a new feature branch from ``develop``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Develop the feature and commit changes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Merge the feature branch back into ``develop``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Delete the feature branch:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do not leave feature branches unmerged for too long. Regularly rebase them on ``develop`` to minimize conflicts."
msgstr ""

msgid "Workflow for Regular Bug Fixes"
msgstr ""

msgid "Create a bug fix branch from ``develop``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Apply the fix and commit changes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Merge the fix branch back into ``develop``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Delete the fix branch:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do not create a ``fix/xxx`` branch from a ``develop/feature_name`` branch. Always branch from ``develop`` to ensure fixes are correctly propagated."
msgstr ""

msgid "Workflow for Critical Hotfixes"
msgstr ""

msgid "Create a hotfix branch from ``main``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Merge the fix back into ``main``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Cherry-pick the fix into ``develop``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Delete the hotfix branch:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do not merge ``fix/xxx`` or ``hotfix/xxx`` directly into ``main`` without following the workflow. Ensure hotfixes are cherry-picked into ``develop`` to avoid losing fixes in future releases."
msgstr ""

msgid "Best Practices"
msgstr ""

msgid "Regularly **rebase feature branches** on ``develop`` to stay up to date:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Avoid long-lived branches to minimize merge conflicts."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ensure bug fixes in ``main`` are **always cherry-picked** to ``develop``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Clearly differentiate between ``fix/xxx`` (non-urgent fixes) and ``hotfix/xxx`` (critical production fixes)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Takeaway"
msgstr ""

msgid "This workflow ensures a structured yet flexible development process while keeping ``main`` stable and ``develop`` always updated with the latest changes."
msgstr ""

msgid "It also ensures that bug fixes are correctly managed and propagated across branches."
