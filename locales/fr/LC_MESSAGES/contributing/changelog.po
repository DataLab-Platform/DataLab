msgstr ""

msgid "üí• Enhancements:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Added new \"Keep results after computation\" option in \"Processing\" section:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before this change, when applying a processing feature (e.g. a filter, a threshold, etc.) on a signal or an image, the analysis results were removed from the object"
msgstr ""

msgid "This new option allows to keep the analysis results after applying a processing feature on a signal or an image. Even if the analysis results are not updated, they might be relevant in some use cases (e.g. when using the 2D peak detection feature on an image, and then applying a filter on the image, or summing two images, etc.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Fixed [Issue #138](https://github.com/DataLab-Platform/DataLab/issues/138) - Image colormaps were no longer stored in metadata (and serialized in HDF5 files) since PlotPy v2.6.3 (this commit, specifically: [PlotPyStack/PlotPy@a37af8a](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/PlotPy/commit/a37af8ae8392e5e3655e5c34b67a7cd1544ea845))"

msgstr ""

msgid "Fixed [Issue #136](https://github.com/DataLab-Platform/DataLab/issues/136) - When processing a signal or an image, the analysis result is kept from original object"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before this fix, when processing a signal or an image (e.g. when applying a filter, a threshold, etc.), the analysis result was kept from the original object, and was not updated with the new data. Thus the analysis result was not meaningful anymore, and was misleading the user."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is now fixed: the analysis result is now removed when processing a signal or an image. However it is not recalculated automatically, because there is no way to know which analysis result should be recalculated (e.g. if the user has applied a filter, should the FWHM be recalculated?) - besides, the current implementation of the analysis features does not allow to recalculate the analysis results automatically when the data is modified. The user has to recalculate the analysis results manually if needed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Fixed [Issue #132](https://github.com/DataLab-Platform/DataLab/issues/132) - Plot analysis results: \"One curve per result title\" mode ignores ROIs"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before this fix, the \"One curve per result title\" mode was ignoring ROIs, and was plotting the selected result for all objects (signals or images) without taking into account the ROI defined on the objects"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is now fixed: the \"One curve per result title\" mode now takes into account the ROI defined on the objects, and plots the selected result for each object (signal or image) and for each ROI defined on the object"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Fixed [Issue #135](https://github.com/DataLab-Platform/DataLab/issues/135) - Allow to edit ROI on multiple signals or images at once"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before this fix, the ROI editor was disabled when multiple signals or images were selected"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is now fixed: the ROI editor is now enabled when multiple signals or images are selected, and the ROI is applied to all selected signals or images (only the ROI of the first selected signal or image is taken into account)"
msgstr ""

msgid "This new behavior is consistent with the ROI extraction feature, which allows to extract the ROI on multiple signals or images at once, based on the ROI defined on the first selected signal or image"
msgstr ""

msgid "Image ROI features:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Fixed [Issue #120](https://github.com/DataLab-Platform/DataLab/issues/120) - ROI extraction on multiple images: defined ROI should not be saved in the first selected object. The design choice is to save the defined ROI neither in the first nor in any of the selected objects: the ROI is only used for the extraction, and is not saved in any object"

msgstr ""

msgid "On Linux, when running a computation on a signal or an image, and on rare occasions, the computation was stuck as if it was running indefinitely. Even though the graphical user interface was still responsive, the computation was not progressing and the user had to cancel the operation and restart it. This was due to the start method of the separate process used for the computation (default method was \"fork\" on Linux). This is now fixed by using the \"spawn\" method instead, which is the recommended method for latest versions of Python on Linux when multithreading is involved."

msgid "Improved plot item style serialization management:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before this release, the plot item style was stored in the signal/image metadata only when saving the workspace to an HDF5 file. So, when modifying the style of a signal/image from the \"Parameters\" button (view toolbar), the style was not kept in some cases (e.g. when duplicating the signal/image)."

msgid "Added \"Plot results\" entry in \"Analysis\" menu:"
msgstr ""

msgid "This feature allows to plot analysis results (1D or 2D)"
msgstr ""

msgid "It creates a new signal with X and Y axes corresponding to user-defined parameters (e.g. X = indices and Y = radius for circle results)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Increased default width of the object selection dialog box:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The object selection dialog box is now wider by default, so that the full signal/image/group titles may be more easily readable"
msgstr ""

msgid "Delete metadata feature:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before this release, the feature was deleting all metadata, including the Regions Of Interest (ROI) metadata, if any."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now a confirmation dialog box is shown to the user before deleting all metadata if the signal/image has ROI metadata: this allows to keep the ROI metadata if needed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Image profile extraction feature: added support for masked images (when defining regions of interest, the areas outside the ROIs are masked, and the profile is extracted only on the unmasked areas, or averaged on the unmasked areas in the case of average profile extraction)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Curve style: added \"Reset curve styles\" in \"View\" menu. This feature allows to reset the curve style cycle to its initial state."

msgstr ""

msgid "Signal and image computations API (`datalab.computations`):"
msgstr ""

msgid "Added wrappers for signal and image 1 -> 1 computations"
msgstr ""

msgid "These wrappers aim at simplifying the creation of a basic computation function operating on DataLab's native objects (`SignalObj` and `ImageObj`) from a function operating on NumPy arrays"
msgstr ""

msgid "This simplifies DataLab's internals and makes it easier to create new computing features inside plugins"
msgstr ""

msgid "See the *datalab_custom_func.py* example plugin for a practical use case"
msgstr ""

msgid "Added \"Radial profile extraction\" feature to image panel's \"Operation\" menu:"
msgstr ""

msgid "This feature allows to extract a radially averaged profile from an image"

msgid "Image ROI extraction feature:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before this release, when extracting a single circular ROI from an image with the \"Extract all ROIs into a single image object\" option enabled, the result was a single image without the ROI mask (the ROI mask was only available when extracting ROI with the option disabled)"
msgstr ""

msgid "This was leading to an unexpected behavior, because one could interpret the result (a square image without the ROI mask) as the result of a single rectangular ROI"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now, when extracting a single circular ROI from an image with the \"Extract all ROIs into a single image object\" option enabled, the result is a single image with the ROI mask (as if the option was disabled)"
msgstr ""

msgid "This fixes [Issue #31](https://github.com/DataLab-Platform/DataLab/issues/31) - Single circular ROI extraction: automatically switch to `compute_extract_roi` function"
msgstr ""

msgid "Analysis on circular ROI:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before this release, when running computations on a circular ROI, the results were unexpected in terms of coordinates (results seemed to be computed in a region located above the actual ROI)."
msgstr ""

msgid "This was due to a regression introduced in an earlier release."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now, when defining a circular ROI and running computations on it, the results are computed on the actual ROI"

msgid "This fixes [Issue #33](https://github.com/DataLab-Platform/DataLab/issues/33) - Analysis on circular ROI: unexpected results"
msgstr ""

msgid "Contour detection on ROI:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before this release, when running contour detection on a ROI, some contours were detected outside the ROI (it may be due to a limitation of the scikit-image `find_contours` function)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now, thanks a workaround, the erroneous contours are filtered out."
msgstr ""

msgid "A new test module `datalab.tests.features.images.contour_fabryperot_app` has been added to test the contour detection feature on a Fabry-Perot image (thanks to [@emarin2642](https://github.com/emarin2642) for the contribution)"
msgstr ""

msgid "This fixes [Issue #34](https://github.com/DataLab-Platform/DataLab/issues/34) - Contour detection: unexpected results outside ROI"
msgstr ""

msgid "Analysis result merging:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before this release, when doing a `1->N` computation (sum, average, product) on a group of signals/images, the analysis results associated to each signal/image were merged into a single result, but only the type of result present in the first signal/image was kept."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now, the analysis results associated to each signal/image are merged into a single result, whatever the type of result is."
msgstr ""

msgid "Fixed [Issue #36](https://github.com/DataLab-Platform/DataLab/issues/36) - \"Delete all\" action enable state is sometimes not refreshed"

msgstr ""

msgid "Image LUT range (contrast/brightness settings) is now saved in the HDF5 file:"
msgstr ""

msgid "As for curve and image styles, the LUT range was already persistent during the working session, but was lost when saving and reloading the HDF5 file"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now, the LUT range is saved in the HDF5 file and is restored when reloading it"
msgstr ""

msgid "Added \"Auto-refresh\" and \"Refresh manually\" actions in \"View\" menu (and main toolbar):"
msgstr ""

msgid "When \"Auto-refresh\" is enabled (default), the plot view is automatically refreshed when a signal/image is modified, added or removed. Even though the refresh is optimized, this may lead to performance issues when working with large datasets."
msgstr ""

msgid "When disabled, the plot view is not automatically refreshed. The user must manually refresh the plot view by clicking on the \"Refresh manually\" button in the main toolbar or by pressing the standard refresh key (e.g. \"F5\")."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added `toggle_auto_refresh` method to DataLab proxy object:"
msgstr ""

msgid "This method allows to toggle the \"Auto-refresh\" feature from a macro-command, a plugin or a remote control client."
msgstr ""

msgid "A context manager `context_no_refresh` is also available to temporarily disable the \"Auto-refresh\" feature from a macro-command, a plugin or a remote control client. Typical usage:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Improved curve readability:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Until this release, the curve style was automatically set by cycling through **PlotPy** predefined styles"
msgstr ""

msgid "However, some styles are not suitable for curve readability (e.g. \"cyan\" and \"yellow\" colors are not readable on a white background, especially when combined with a \"dashed\" line style)"
msgstr ""

msgid "This release introduces a new curve style management with colors which are distinguishable and accessible, even to color vision deficiency people"
msgstr ""

msgid "Added \"Curve anti-aliasing\" feature to \"View\" menu (and toolbar):"
msgstr ""

msgid "This feature allows to enable/disable curve anti-aliasing (default: enabled)"
msgstr ""

msgid "When enabled, the curve rendering is smoother but may lead to performance issues when working with large datasets (that's why it can be disabled)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Added `toggle_show_titles` method to DataLab proxy object. This method allows to toggle the \"Show graphical object titles\" feature from a macro-command, a plugin or a remote control client."
msgstr ""

msgid "Remote client is now checking the server version and shows a warning message if the server version may not be fully compatible with the client version."
msgstr ""

msgid "Image contour detection feature (\"Analysis\" menu):"
msgstr ""

msgid "The contour detection feature was not taking into account the \"shape\" parameter (circle, ellipse, polygon) when computing the contours. The parameter was stored but really used only when calling the feature a second time."
msgstr ""
