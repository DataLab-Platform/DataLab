### üîÑ Support for Data Acquisition

Adding support for data acquisition would be a major step forward in making DataLab not only a platform for signal and image processing, but also a **versatile tool for real-time experimental workflows**. The idea would be to allow users to acquire data directly from various hardware devices (e.g., cameras, digitizers, spectrometers, etc.) **within DataLab itself**.

Such a feature would enable **seamless integration between acquisition and analysis**, allowing users to process and visualize data immediately after it is captured, without needing to switch tools or export/import files.

While no formal design has been established yet, a viable approach could be to:

* Introduce a **new plugin family dedicated to data acquisition**, following the modular architecture of DataLab;
* Define a **generic API for acquisition plugins**, ensuring flexibility and compatibility across device types;
* **Leverage existing solutions** such as [PyMoDAQ](https://pymodaq.cnrs.fr/), a Python-based data acquisition framework already compatible with a wide range of laboratory instruments.

A potential **collaboration with the PyMoDAQ development team** could be explored, to benefit from their ecosystem and avoid duplicating efforts. This would also help foster interoperability and promote open standards in the Python scientific instrumentation community.

### üåê Web Frontend

As DataLab's modular architecture evolves, a natural next step is to provide a **web-based frontend** to complement the existing desktop application.

A web frontend would allow users to:

* **Run DataLab remotely** (e.g. from a server or cloud platform) and access it via a browser;
* Perform processing and visualization tasks without needing a local Python environment;
* Facilitate **collaborative data analysis**, sharing sessions or results with colleagues;
* Integrate with JupyterHub, dashboards, or lab management tools for centralized usage.

This frontend could be built on top of the upcoming `DataLab-core` library, exposing its features through a web interface ‚Äî possibly leveraging tools like **JupyterLab extensions**, **Panel**, or **Dash**, depending on the chosen stack.

While still exploratory, this direction would increase **accessibility, portability, and scalability** of DataLab, especially in academic, industrial, and cloud-based environments.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Support for Time Series

DataLab currently focuses on generic signal and image processing, but many use cases ‚Äî especially in scientific instrumentation and experimental physics ‚Äî involve **time series data**.

Adding dedicated support for time series would make it easier to:

* Handle signals with associated timestamps or non-uniform sampling;
* Perform time-aware processing and visualization (e.g., event alignment, time-based filtering, resampling);
* Integrate with external systems generating time-indexed data.

This feature is tracked in [Issue #27](https://github.com/DataLab-Platform/DataLab/issues/27), where potential use cases and design considerations are discussed.

Introducing robust time series handling would broaden DataLab‚Äôs applicability in domains such as data logging, slow control, and real-time monitoring.

### üóÉÔ∏è Database Connectors

Currently, DataLab operates primarily on files and in-memory data structures. Adding **connectors to databases** would significantly extend its capabilities, especially for users dealing with large, structured, or historical datasets.

This feature would allow DataLab to:

* **Query and load data** from SQL or NoSQL databases (e.g. PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.);
* Support metadata-driven workflows, where experiments or datasets are referenced from a database;
* **Store analysis results** or annotations back into a database for traceability and reproducibility;
* Facilitate integration into lab information management systems (LIMS) or enterprise data infrastructures.

The design could include:

* A **plugin-based system** for supporting various database backends;
* A simple configuration interface for connection settings and query management;
* Integration with pandas or SQLAlchemy for flexible data exchange.

This evolution would help bridge the gap between **data acquisition, analysis, and long-term storage**, enabling more robust scientific data workflows.

### üìì Jupyter Plugin for Interactive Data Analysis

Although DataLab can already be remotely controlled from a Jupyter notebook ‚Äî thanks to its existing remote control capabilities (see {ref}`ref-to-remote-control`) ‚Äî the user experience could be greatly enhanced by developing a **dedicated Jupyter plugin**.

This plugin would provide a **tighter integration** between Jupyter and DataLab, offering the following features:

* Use DataLab as a **Jupyter kernel**, enabling direct access to its processing capabilities from within a notebook;
* **Display numerical results from DataLab in Jupyter**, and vice versa ‚Äî for example, importing results computed in a Jupyter notebook into the DataLab interface;
* Allow **interactive data manipulation**: use DataLab for efficient signal and image operations, and Jupyter for custom or home-made data analysis routines;
* Bridge scripting and GUI workflows, making DataLab more attractive for scientific users familiar with Jupyter environments.

Technically, this plugin could rely on the **Jupyter kernel interface** to expose DataLab's capabilities in an interactive programming context.

Such integration would reinforce DataLab‚Äôs role in the scientific Python ecosystem and facilitate reproducible, notebook-driven analysis workflows.

### üß© Spyder Plugin for Interactive Data Analysis

A plugin for the [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) would address the **same use cases as the Jupyter plugin**, providing seamless integration between DataLab and Spyder‚Äôs interactive environment.

This plugin would allow users to:

* Interact with DataLab directly from Spyder;
* Visualize or send data between the DataLab GUI and the Spyder console;
* Use DataLab‚Äôs processing capabilities in real time while scripting custom analysis workflows in Spyder.

As with the Jupyter integration, this plugin could be implemented by leveraging the **Jupyter kernel interface** (see {ref}`ref-to-remote-control`), which Spyder already supports internally.

Such a plugin would enhance DataLab's usability for scientists and engineers who prefer Spyder‚Äôs integrated development environment for exploratory analysis.

### üß† Jupyter Kernel Interface for DataLab

Implementing a native **Jupyter kernel interface** for DataLab would provide a more integrated way to use it from other environments such as **Jupyter notebooks, Spyder, or Visual Studio Code**.

This interface would allow:

* Direct control of DataLab from third-party tools that support Jupyter kernels;
* **Two-way data exchange**: e.g., displaying DataLab results inside a notebook, or visualizing Jupyter-generated data inside the DataLab GUI;
* Tighter integration into scripting workflows and IDEs beyond simple remote control.

However, based on initial exploration, implementing a full Jupyter kernel may be **non-trivial and potentially time-consuming**. Given that remote control already enables communication between DataLab and Jupyter (see {ref}`ref-to-remote-control`), the added value of a full kernel integration should be carefully evaluated against its complexity and maintenance cost.

This option remains open for discussion depending on user demand and development resources.

### üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance Plan

#### üîÑ 2026: Transition to gRPC for Remote Control

DataLab currently relies on XML-RPC for remote control, which may become a limitation for more advanced or high-performance use cases. If the need arises for a more **efficient, robust, and extensible communication protocol**, a switch to **gRPC** is under consideration.

This improvement is tracked in [Issue #18](https://github.com/DataLab-Platform/DataLab/issues/18).

#### üö´ 2025: Drop Qt5 Support and Migrate to Qt6

With the **end-of-life of Qt5 scheduled for mid-2025**, DataLab will fully migrate to **Qt6**.
This transition is expected to be **straightforward**, thanks to:

* The use of the `qtpy` abstraction layer;
* The fact that the `PlotPyStack` library is already compatible with Qt6.

This change will ensure compatibility with future versions of Qt and modern Python environments.

### üß± Other Tasks

#### üß© Create a DataLab Plugin Template

To encourage community contributions and facilitate the development of extensions, a **template for creating DataLab plugins** is planned.

This template would:

* Provide a ready-to-use scaffold with best practices;
* Help new developers quickly understand the plugin architecture;
* Promote consistency and modularity across third-party plugins.

The task is tracked in [Issue #26](https://github.com/DataLab-Platform/DataLab/issues/26).
