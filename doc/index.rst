DataLab
=======

DataLab is an **open-source platform for scientific and technical data processing
and visualization** with unique features designed to meet industrial requirements
(see :ref:`key_strengths`: Extensibility, Interoperability, ...).
It is based on Python scientific libraries (such as NumPy, SciPy or scikit-image)
and Qt graphical user interfaces (thanks to the powerful `PlotPyStack`_).
