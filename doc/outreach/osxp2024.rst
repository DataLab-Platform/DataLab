Conference Overview
-------------------

In December 2024, DataLab was showcased at `Open Source Experience 2024 <https://www.opensource-experience.com/>`_ in Paris, one of Europe's largest events dedicated to open-source software and communities. This conference provided an opportunity to present DataLab to a broader audience beyond the scientific Python ecosystem.

Open Source Experience brings together developers, decision-makers, and open-source enthusiasts from various domains, creating a unique opportunity to demonstrate how scientific open-source software can bridge research and industry.

DataLab at OSXP 2024
--------------------

**Presentation Context**

Open Source Experience 2024 featured DataLab as an example of:

- **Open-source scientific software** that meets industrial requirements
- **Community-driven development** backed by institutional and commercial support
- **Cross-domain applicability** from research laboratories to production environments

**Key Messages**

The presentation at OSXP 2024 emphasized:

**Open Source as a Bridge**
    How DataLab connects academic research (CEA) with industrial software development (CODRA) through open-source collaboration.

**Industrial-Grade Open Source**
    Demonstrating that open-source scientific software can achieve the reliability and robustness required for production use:

    - Systematic testing and validation
    - Professional documentation
    - Multi-platform support
    - Long-term maintenance commitment

**Ecosystem Integration**
    DataLab's role within the broader scientific Python ecosystem, leveraging NumPy, SciPy, scikit-image, and OpenCV.

**Funding Diversity**
    Showcasing multiple funding sources (CEA, CODRA, NLnet/European Commission) as a model for sustainable open-source development.

Audience and Engagement
------------------------

The OSXP audience brought a different perspective compared to scientific Python conferences:

**Diverse Background**
    Attendees included:

    - Corporate decision-makers evaluating open-source solutions
    - Public sector representatives interested in scientific tools
    - Open-source advocates from various technical domains
    - Students discovering scientific computing possibilities

**Key Questions**
    The audience was particularly interested in:

    - **Licensing**: BSD 3-Clause license and its implications for commercial use
    - **Governance**: The DataLab Platform organization and decision-making process
    - **Sustainability**: Long-term maintenance and development plans

Broader Impact
--------------

Presenting at Open Source Experience helped DataLab reach new audiences:

**Enterprise Awareness**
    Companies outside the scientific computing domain discovered DataLab as a potential solution for their data processing needs.

**Public Sector Interest**
    Government agencies and research institutions learned about DataLab as a validated open-source alternative to proprietary solutions.

**Education Sector**
    Universities and technical schools identified DataLab as a teaching tool for signal and image processing.

**Cross-Pollination**
    Connections with other open-source projects opened possibilities for integration and collaboration.

DataLab's Open Source Model

   * - Aspect
     - Description
   * - **Development**
     - Open development on GitHub with public roadmap and issue tracking
   * - **Funding**
     - Mixed funding from public research (CEA), commercial (CODRA), and grants (NLnet)
   * - **License**
     - BSD 3-Clause for maximum freedom and adoption
   * - **Governance**
     - DataLab Platform organization with contributors from multiple institutions
   * - **Support**
     - Community support via GitHub + professional support via CODRA
   * - **Distribution**
     - Multiple channels: PyPI, conda-forge, Debian, Windows installers

This model demonstrates how scientific open-source projects can achieve sustainability while maintaining their open nature.

Significance for DataLab
-------------------------

The presence at Open Source Experience 2024 marked an important milestone:

**Maturity Recognition**
    Being selected for presentation at a major open-source conference validated DataLab's maturity and relevance.

**Broader Mission**
    Confirmed DataLab's mission extends beyond scientific research to serve the wider open-source and industrial communities.

**European Dimension**
    Emphasized DataLab's European roots and alignment with European open-source values and funding (NLnet/EC).

**Sustainable Model**
    Demonstrated a viable model for developing scientific open-source software with mixed public/private funding.
