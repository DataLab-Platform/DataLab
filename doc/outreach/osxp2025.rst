Abstract
--------

In the field of non-destructive testing, the CEA entrusted CODRA with the specification, design, and development of software for the automatic reconstruction of radiographic images, entirely based on open-source components and contributing to the scientific Python ecosystem.

**Key Technical Aspects:**

**Geometric Pattern-Based Reconstruction**
    Using a grid of geometric markers placed within the radiographed field, the algorithm automatically assembles a complete scene from partial images, without any prior external information (position, orientation, magnification).

**Complex Parametrizable Processing**
    The complex and configurable processing workflow was developed and refined using the open-source DataLab platform, remotely controlled to dynamically visualize each step of the pipeline.

**Real-World Application**
    The creation of this software paves the way for new applications in the fields of industrial imaging and security.

DataLab's Role in the Project
------------------------------

This presentation showcases DataLab in a real-world industrial application, demonstrating several key capabilities:

**Remote Control for Development**
    DataLab was used as a remote-controlled visualization and processing platform during algorithm development, allowing developers to:

    - Visualize intermediate results at each pipeline step
    - Fine-tune parameters interactively
    - Debug complex image processing algorithms
    - Validate processing results in real-time

**Visual Debugging**
    The ability to send data from the main application to DataLab for visualization proved invaluable for:

    - Understanding algorithm behavior
    - Identifying edge cases and failure modes
    - Optimizing processing parameters
    - Validating geometric transformations

**Rapid Prototyping**
    DataLab's ready-to-use image processing features enabled rapid prototyping of the reconstruction pipeline.

**Production Integration**
    The software demonstrates how DataLab can be integrated into production-grade industrial applications.

Technical Challenges Addressed
-------------------------------

The automatic X-ray scene reconstruction project involved several complex challenges:

**Geometric Calibration**
    Automatic detection and analysis of geometric reference patterns in X-ray images.

**Image Registration**
    Aligning and stitching partial images without prior knowledge of their spatial relationship.

**Scale and Orientation Estimation**
    Determining magnification factors and angular orientation from the geometric grid alone.

**Robust Processing**
    Handling variations in image quality, exposure, and geometric distortions.

**Performance Optimization**
    Ensuring the reconstruction process runs efficiently for practical use.

Open Source Ecosystem Contribution
-----------------------------------

This project exemplifies how industrial applications can both benefit from and contribute to the open-source scientific Python ecosystem:

**Leveraging Open Source**
    The software is built entirely on open-source components:

    - **Python** as the development platform
    - **NumPy** and **SciPy** for numerical computing
    - **scikit-image** and **OpenCV** for image processing
    - **DataLab** for visualization and algorithm development

**Contributing Back**
    The project contributes to the ecosystem by:

    - Validating DataLab's capabilities in demanding industrial applications
    - Providing feedback for DataLab's development
    - Demonstrating real-world use cases for the community
    - Potentially contributing algorithms or improvements back to open-source libraries

Industrial and Research Collaboration
-------------------------------------

This presentation highlights successful collaboration between public research and private industry:

**CEA (Public Research)**
    - Defined the scientific and technical requirements
    - Provided domain expertise in non-destructive testing

**CODRA (Technical and Scientific Software Development Company)**
    - Translated functional specifications into algorithms through mathematical modeling (e.g. homographic transformations, coordinate system conversions)
    - Validated the reconstruction algorithms
    - Designed and developed the software solution
    - Integrated open-source components
    - Ensured industrial-grade quality and robustness
    - Leveraged DataLab for development

**Benefits of Collaboration**
    - Combines research excellence with industrial rigor
    - Accelerates technology transfer from research to application
    - Ensures solutions meet both scientific and practical requirements
    - Promotes open-source adoption in industrial contexts
