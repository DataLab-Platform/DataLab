"Automatically refresh the visualization when the data changes. When "
"enabled (default), the plot view is automatically refreshed when the data"
" changes. When disabled, the plot view is not refreshed until you "
"manually refresh it by clicking the \"Refresh manually\" button in the "
"toolbar. Even though the refresh algorithm is optimized, it may still "
"take some time to refresh the plot view when the data changes, especially"
" when the data set is large. Therefore, you may want to disable the auto-"
"refresh feature when you are working with large data sets, and enable it "
"again when you are done. This will avoid unnecessary refreshes."
