# Version 1.4 #

## DataLab Version 1.4.0 ##

### ✨ New Features ###

**Brightness and contrast:**

* A new **Processing > Exposure > Brightness and contrast** operation provides a histogram with synchronized minimum, maximum, brightness and contrast controls, deterministic Auto and Reset actions, ROI-aware remapping, and live preview. One input window is initialized from the first selected image and applied to the full selection, with each result preserving its source image and data type.
* Intensity windows may extend beyond the observed data range. Exact floating-point bounds survive editing and reapplication, while declared parameter constraints remain enforced and Cancel preserves the original parameters.

**Live processing preview:**

* Parameter dialogs for compatible 1-to-1 processing now offer an optional live preview for signals and images, including image-to-signal operations. Preview is off by default; Cancel leaves the workspace unchanged, while OK reuses a completed current preview for a single source and otherwise performs the normal processing on the original selection.
* Completed previews keep their dedicated process ready for later dialogs, avoiding repeated process startup. Cancelling a preview that is still running stops its process so speculative work cannot continue in the background.
* Bounded numeric parameters now offer sliders alongside precise text entry. The Processing tab retains Apply and automatic re-processing, with updates deferred until slider release and valid input.
