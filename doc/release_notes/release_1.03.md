# Version 1.3 #

## DataLab Version 1.3.0 ##

### ✨ New Features ###

**Result titles can show source object names:**

After a processing operation, result titles are built from source object short
identifiers (e.g. `fft(s001)`). A new setting now lets you display the source
object *titles* instead (e.g. `fft(My signal)`), making processed objects easier
to identify in the object tree.

* Available under **Settings → Processing → Result management → Result titles**
* Two choices: *Source object short identifier* (default) or *Source object title*
* Result titles update automatically when a source object is renamed
* Switching the option back instantly restores the short-identifier display
* Display-only: object identity, computation results and saved files are unchanged

**Third-party plugin discovery via environment variable:**

* Added support for the `DATALAB_PLUGINS` environment variable, allowing one or more directories to be specified as additional plugin search paths
* Multiple directories can be listed using the OS path separator (`;` on Windows, `:` on Linux/macOS), following the same convention as `PYTHONPATH`
* Listed directories are appended to the existing plugin search paths at startup and are picked up automatically by the plugin discovery mechanism
* Non-existent directories are silently skipped (a warning is recorded in the log file), so a stale environment variable on another machine will not prevent DataLab from starting

**Replace special values processing (signal and image):**

DataLab now provides a dedicated **"Replace special values"** processing
function that detects and replaces `NaN`, `+Inf` and `-Inf` values in both
signals and images. The feature is available under
**Processing → Level adjustment → Replace special values** in both the Signal
and Image panels.

* Each target (`NaN`, `+Inf`, `-Inf`) can be processed independently with its
  own strategy
* Signal strategies: do nothing, replace with zero / constant / minimum /
  maximum / mean / median, delete affected points, forward fill, backward
  fill, interpolation (linear, spline, quadratic, cubic, PCHIP), N-neighbor
  minimum / maximum / mean / median
* Image strategies: do nothing, replace with zero / constant / minimum /
  maximum / mean / median, N-neighbor minimum / maximum / mean / median
* The parameter dialog displays **colored badges** showing the number (and
  percentage) of `NaN`, `+Inf` and `-Inf` samples found in the source object,
  giving immediate visibility on what will be modified
* When a neighbor strategy is selected, a **live kernel preview** shows the
  shape of the neighborhood that will be used for the replacement
* Integer images are handled explicitly: because `NaN` and infinite values
  cannot exist in integer data, the dialog explains that the operation is not
  applicable and prevents accidental processing, while preserving the original
  image data type without unnecessary float conversion
