The "HDF5 Browser" is a modal dialog box allowing to import almost any
1D and 2D data into DataLab workspace (and eventually metadata).

Compatible curve or image data are displayed in a hierarchical view
on the left panel, as well as other scalar data (scalar values are just
shown for context purpose and may not be imported into DataLab workspace).

The HDF5 browser is fairly simple to use:
  * On the left panel, select the curve or image data you want to import
  * Selected data is plotted on the right panel
  * Click on "Check all" if you want to import all compatible data
  * Then validate by clicking on "OK"
