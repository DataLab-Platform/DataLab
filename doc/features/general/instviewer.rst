About CodraFT installation
==========================

Because of the multiple ways of installing CodraFT on your machine,
understanding why the application behaves unexpectedly without any
information on your configuration could be very challenging.

That is why CodraFT provides the dialog box "About CodraFT installation".

    About your CodraFT installation (see "?" menu)

Reporting unexpected behavior or any other bug on `GitHub Issues`_
will be greatly appreciated, especially if above contents are attached
to the report (as well log files, see :ref:`ref-to-logviewer`).
