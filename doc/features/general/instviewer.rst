Installation and configuration viewer
=====================================

    :description: DataLab's installation and configuration viewer
    :keywords: installation, configuration, viewer, DataLab

Because of the multiple ways of installing DataLab on your machine,
understanding why the application behaves unexpectedly without any
information on your configuration could be very challenging.

That is why DataLab provides the dialog box "Installation and configuration"
which gathers all the information about your installation and configuration.

.. note::

  The installation and configuration viewer is accessible from the "?" menu in the main window.

Reporting unexpected behavior or any other bug on `GitHub Issues`_
will be greatly appreciated, especially if above contents are attached
to the report (as well log files, see :ref:`ref-to-logviewer`).
