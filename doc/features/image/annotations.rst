Annotations (Images)
====================

DataLab provides an annotation feature for images (as well as for signals).

.. image:: /images/annotations/view_menu_entry.png

How to use the feature:
  - Create or open an image in DataLab workspace
  - Double-click on the image or select "View in a new window" in "View" menu
  - Add annotations (labels, rectangles, circles, etc.)
  - Eventually customize the annotations (right-click, "Parameters")
  - Validate your changes by clicking on "OK" button
  - That's it: your annotations are now attached to the image
    and will be saved with your DataLab workspace

.. figure:: /images/annotations/image_annotations1.png

    Annotations may be added in the separate view.

Once the annotations have been added in the separate view (see above),
they are part of the object (image) metadata (see below).

    Annotations are now part of the image metadata.

.. note::
    Annotations may be copied from an image to another by using the
    "copy/paste metadata" features.
