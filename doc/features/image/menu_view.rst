View options for Images
=======================

.. figure:: /images/shots/i_view.png

    Screenshot of the "View" menu.

When the "Image Panel" is selected, the menus and toolbars are updated to
provide image-related actions.

The "View" menu allows you to visualize the current image or group of images.
It also allows you to show/hide titles, to show/hide the contrast panel, to
refresh the visualization, and so on.

View in a new window
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a new window to visualize and the selected images.

In the separate window, you may visualize your data more comfortably
(e.g., by maximizing the window) and you may also annotate the data.

Edit annotations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a new window to edit annotations.

.. seealso::
    See :ref:`ref-to-image-annotations` for more details on annotations.

Auto-refresh
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Automatically refresh the visualization when the data changes.
When enabled (default), the plot view is automatically refreshed when the
data changes. When disabled, the plot view is not refreshed until you
manually refresh it by clicking the "Refresh manually" button in the
toolbar. Even though the refresh algorithm is optimized, it may still
take some time to refresh the plot view when the data changes, especially
when the data set is large. Therefore, you may want to disable the
auto-refresh feature when you are working with large data sets,
and enable it again when you are done. This will avoid unnecessary
refreshes.

Refresh manually
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Refresh the visualization manually. This triggers a refresh of the plot
view, even if the auto-refresh feature is disabled.

Show contrast panel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Show/hide contrast adjustment panel.

Show graphical object titles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Show/hide titles of computing results or annotations.

Other menu entries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Show/hide panels or toolbars.
