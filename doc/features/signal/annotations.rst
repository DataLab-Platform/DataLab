Annotations (Signals)
=====================

CodraFT provides an annotation feature for signals (as well as for images).

.. image:: /images/annotations/view_menu_entry.png

How to use the feature:
  - Create or open a signal in CodraFT workspace
  - Double-click on the signal or select "View in a new window" in "View" menu
  - Add annotations (labels, cursors, rectangles and segments)
  - Eventually customize the annotations (right-click, "Parameters")
  - Validate your changes by clicking on "OK" button
  - That's it: your annotations are now attached to the signal
    and will be saved with your CodraFT workspace

    Example of annotations.

Once the annotations have been added in the separate view (see above),
they are part of the object (signal) metadata (see below).

.. note::
    Annotations may be copied from a signal to another by using the
    "copy/paste metadata" features.
