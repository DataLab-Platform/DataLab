DataLab is an open platform for signal and image processing.
Its functional scope is intentionally broad. With its many functions,
some of them technically advanced, DataLab enables the processing and
visualization of all types of scientific data. As a result, scientific,
industrial, and innovation stakeholders can have access to an
easy-to-use tool that is simple to adapt and offers the reliability
of industrial-grade software.
