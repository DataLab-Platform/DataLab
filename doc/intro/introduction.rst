Use cases, main features and key strengths
==========================================

DataLab is a platform for data processing and visualization (signals or images)
that includes many functions. Developed in Python, it benefits from the
richness of the associated ecosystem in terms of scientific and
technical libraries.

What are the applications for Datalab?
--------------------------------------

Real world examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A few concrete and specific examples illustrate the nature of the work
that can be carried out with DataLab:

- Processing of experimental data (signals and images) acquired on a scientific facility
  in the nuclear field
- Processing of data acquired by a sensor in an industrial context
- Processing of images acquired by a camera in a medical context
- Automatic detection of defects on a surface, in the context of quality control
- Automatic detection of laser spots on a target, in the context of laser alignment
- Instrument alignment through image processing
- Automatic pattern detection on images and geometric correction of the images, in
  the context of non destructive testing

Usage modes
^^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on the application, DataLab can be used in three different modes:

- **Stand-alone mode**: DataLab is a full-fledged processing application that
  can be adapted to the client's needs through the addition of
  industry-specific plugins.
- **Embedded mode**: DataLab is integrated into your application to provide
  the necessary processing and visualization features.
- **Remote-controlled mode**: DataLab communicates with your application,
  allowing it to benefit from its functionality without disrupting
  the user experience.

    For practical examples of use cases, see the :ref:`tutorials` section:

    - Most of the tutorials are describing concrete examples of use of DataLab
      in a scientific or technical context.

    - Regarding the use of DataLab with an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
      such as Visual Studio Code or Spyder, see the tutorial :ref:`tutorial_spyder`.

    - As for the use of DataLab with Jupyter notebooks, that is one of the topics
      covered in the tutorial :ref:`tutorial_extensibility`.

DataLab is a versatile tool that can be used in different contexts:

Data processing
  DataLab is a powerful tool for processing signals and images. It can be used
  to develop complex algorithms, or to quickly prototype a processing chain.

  :octicon:`book;1em;sd-text-info` See our :bdg-ref-success-line:`Tutorials <tutorials>`
  for practical examples of use in data processing.

Companion tool for scientific/technical work
  DataLab can be used as a companion tool for scientific/technical work. It
  allows you to visualize and process data, and to share your results with your
  colleagues. It can easily be adapted to your needs through the addition of
  plugins, and it may even be used together with your every day tools (e.g.,
  Visual Studio Code, Spyder, ... or Jupyter notebooks).

  :octicon:`book;1em;sd-text-info` See our :bdg-ref-success-line:`Tutorials <tutorials>`
  for practical examples of use in a scientific/technical context.

Prototyping a data processing application
  DataLab can be used to quickly prototype a data processing application. It can
  then be used as a basis for the development of a full-fledged application.

  :octicon:`book;1em;sd-text-info` See the tutorial :ref:`tutorial_custom_func`
  for a concrete example.

Debugging a data processing application
  DataLab can be used as an advanced debugging tool for your data processing
  applications, independently from the development environment or the language
  used (Python, C#, C++, ...). All you need is to be able to communicate with
  DataLab via its remote control interface (standard XML-RPC protocol). This
  allows you to send data to DataLab (signals, images or even geometric shapes),
  visualize the data at each step of the processing chain, manipulate them to
  better understand the behavior of your algorithms, and even modify them to
  test the robustness of your code.

  :octicon:`bug;1em;sd-text-warning` See the tutorial :ref:`debug_spyder`
  for a quick overview of this feature.

.. note::

    DataLab can also be controlled from your familiar development environment
    (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Spyder, ...) or from a Jupyter notebook, in order
    to perform calculations using your processing functions while leveraging the
    advanced features of DataLab. :octicon:`book;1em;sd-text-info`
    See the tutorials :ref:`tutorial_custom_func` or :ref:`tutorial_spyder`
    for examples of use.

With its user-friendly experience and versatile usage modes, DataLab enables
efficient development of your data processing and visualization applications
while benefiting from an industrial-grade technological platform.

Main features
-------------

The main technical features of DataLab include:

- Support for numerous standard and proprietary data formats
- Opening an arbitrary number of objects (signals or images) for batch
  processing, with the possibility of defining groups of objects
- Simultaneous viewing of multiple objects with annotation support
- Standard operations and processing on signals and images
- Advanced image processing (restoration, morphology, edge detection, etc.)
- Management of multiple regions of interest (calculations, extractions)
- Macro-command editor
- Remote-controllable API
- Embedded interactive Python console

.. _key_strengths:

Key strengths
-------------

To summarize, the four key strengths of DataLab are:

Extensibility
  The DataLab plugin system makes it easy to code new features (specific
  processing, specific file formats, custom graphical interfaces). It can also
  be used as a customizable platform.

Interoperability
  DataLab can also be embedded in your own application. For example, within data
  processing software, machine-level control systems, or test bench
  applications.

Automation
  A high-level public API allows for full remote control of DataLab to open and
  process data.

Maintainability and testability
  DataLab is an industrial-grade scientific and technical processing software.
  The built-in automated tests in DataLab cover 90% of its features, which is
  significant for software with graphical interfaces and helps mitigate
  regression risks.
